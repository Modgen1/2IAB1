    "\n",
    "Over the past three years, the Netherlands and much of Europe faced an energy crisis not seen since the 1970s. The price of natural gas skyrocketed from around &euro; 20 per MWh to over &euro; 200 per MWh in [less than a year](https://allecijfers.nl/gas/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, [20%](https://www.energie-nederland.nl/onderwerpen/energiesysteem/feiten-en-cijfers/) of the gas in the Netherlands was used to produce electricity, while [33%](https://www.energie-nederland.nl/onderwerpen/energiesysteem/feiten-en-cijfers/) of it was consumed by households for heating, cooking and warming water. [90%](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84948NED/table) of households still rely on gas for heating, and the price increase significantly affected many families. People responded by lowering their thermostats, taking shorter showers, improving home insulation, and finding other ways to save energy. Although energy prices have since decreased, this period highlighted the significant impact of energy consumption on everyday life. This issue is also critical in the context of the climate goals and the reduction targets set by the [European Energy Efficiency Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en).\n",
    "\n",
    "To set realistic targets in governmental policies, it is essential to understand how various factors influence household energy consumption. In this assignment we will examine the impact of weather, primarily temperature, and basic socioeconomic factors on the average natural gas consumption of different types of households in Dutch municipalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id='toc1_2_1_'></a>[Origin of the Data](#toc0_)\n",
    "We will use socioeconomic and energy consumption data from [Statistics Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb), known as CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek) in the Netherlands.\n",
    "This data can be accessed as Open Data through the [StatLine data portal](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=en&_catalog=CBS).\n",
    "CBS obtains the energy consumption data from [C-AR](https://www.edsn.nl/marktpartijen/), the central registry of the energy companies in the Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the relationship between the energy consumption and weather, we will also analyze [climatologic data](https://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/uurgegevens) collected by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut, KNMI).\n",
    "The data comes from 50 meteorological stations recording various weather measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather stations considered in this assignment are shown in Figure 1 below. \n",

During summer, heating systems are mostly idle, while in winter they work hard to keep houses warm. Wind can further increase gas consumption by making it harder to maintain indoor warmth.\n",

    "However, the current temperature and wind speed are not reliable predictors of whether the heating is on or how hard it is working right now. For example, a summer night might see temperatures drop to 10°C, but the heating system remains off because the house retains warmth from the day. Conversely, the heating system might be active on a winter afternoon with the same 10°C outside temperature even if it is not windy.\n",

    "Under this assumption, that is no difference in gas consumption for heating between days with the effective temperature of 16°C and those with 18°C. \n",
