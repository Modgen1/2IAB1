Formulate a question that you may reasonably be able to answer with the data you have here.

For example, at night, heating might be set to maintain the room temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, but during the day the thermostat is set to maintain the temperature at 20 degrees Celsius. You could write a problem statement related to the presence of such patterns in the data.\n",

The data you have here is very different from GA1, but you could train a regression model using weather and gas usage data and then explore potential bias of your model.

This data set has at least one clear form of atypical data, already visible in Section 7 (Taking a first look at the data). There are periods when energy consumption is much lower than surrounding periods: less gas and/or electricity was used than just before and after that period. Perhaps the people who live in this house were away on holiday. Whatever the case may be, these periods are not representative of normal use of gas and electricity.\n",

Taking the maximum value might work, but there could be outliers, making days with very low energy consumption look like a regular day.
